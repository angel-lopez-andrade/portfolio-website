                        <h3>Language Learning</h3>
                        <p>As my degree had a large amount of elective space, I was able to dabble in a variety of different languages, including;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Chinese (Mandarin)</li>
                            <li>French</li>
                            <li>Japanese</li>
                            <li>Spanish</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This has led me to really enjoy learning about the how's and why's of these tools that we use to communicate, and allowed me to dive in and be able to broaden my horizons with not only different tongues, but also the cultures and people behind them.</p>
                        <p>Learning human languages I'd say has also helped me in being able to comprehend programming languages to an extent, as a lot of the fundamentals are similar in both.</p>

                        <h3>Metal</h3>
                        <p>I've been deep into metal ever since I discovered <a href="sputnikmusic.com">sputnikmusic.com</a> in high school - a site which led me on a deeper and deeper (heavier and heavier) rabbit hole into the genre of music and all of its unique subgenres.</p>
                        <p>I'm currently digging melodic black metal, technical death metal, and the hybrid-genres of post-hardcore and metalcore.</p>
                        <p>In addition to metal however, I'm also quite impartial to some good pop-punk.</p>

                        <h3>Videogames</h3>
                        <p>A hobby I share with many other millenials - videogames!</p>
                        <p>I enjoy the interactive nature of the entertainment medium, as opposed to, say, watching TV, and can sometimes be found spending too many hours of the day immersed in its virtual worlds.</p>
                        <p>Some of my favourite videogame genres include;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>MMORPG</li>
                            <li>FPS</li>
                            <li>Collectible Card Games</li>

                        <h3>Food Appreciation</h3>
                        <p>I'm a big foodie, and enjoy adventuring into the deep realm of world cuisines. Whilst this is mainly on the eating side of things, I'm pretty keen on learning how to cook a bit sometime soon!</p>
                        <p>Us Sydneysiders are afforded an amazing culinary scene thanks to the diversity of the city and its expansive range of suburbs - Basically every type of national cuisine can be found in the metropolitan area.</p>
                        <p>Lately I've been interested in the concept of fusion cuisine, and how we might be able to pioneer new and exciting flavour combinations by mixing together non-traditional ingredients and foreign influences into traditional, monoculture dishes.</p>
