                <h3>Major in International Business</h3>
                <p>I studied at Macquarie University in northern Sydney, where I completed a Bachelor of Arts with a major in International Business.</p>
                <p>Whilst this was a fun degree and afforded me a lot of room to experiment with electives, I found that the field of study was really to broad to be of much practical use for what companies want in fresh graduates, and a lot of the theories we learned seem to be built for mid-career managers (who actually make the decisions in their companies' international divisions - something a fresh graduate of course wouldn't!).</p>
                <p>I found myself drawn to the linguistical side of things - putting a lot of my electives into national languages (amongst other experimentation), and this eventually led me to discover programming languages too.</p>

                <h3>A Textbook On A Whim</h3>
                <p>During my degree, I was fortunate enough to be accepted into a student internship at Hitachi in Japan - where I worked in the General Affairs department over the winter.</p>
                <p>Hitachi, being quite a tech-savvy firm, got me curious about the IT industry, and one day in a bookstore, I purchased a beginner's Java textbook - pictured, on a whim. This was my first taste of programming.</p>
                <p>As I read through it, I became increasingly interested in programming languages. After finishing up two textbooks, I found that Java, as a primarily back-end language, wasn't really scratching that itch for seeing your own work unfold, especially given my beginner level and my lack of project inspiration.</p>

                <h3>Discovering More Languages</h3>
                <p>This led me to freeCodeCamp - a community-run, free online bootcamp-style course that I found on the web one day. This course had a focus on front-end development at the start, which had me interested as I was looking for something more visual after a while of Java.</p>
                <p>I completed the first two freeCodeCamp modules over the next few months, and got to make a couple of simple page designs and check out a bit of JavaScript - AKA the front-end side of things.</p>
                <p>While I learned a lot from freeCodeCamp, I was still somewhat lacking a structure in my study, which I felt would push me to the next level in learning.</p>

                <h3>Taking Some Electives</h3>
                <p>In order to get some structure in my study, I ended up taking a couple of programming-related electives at university - as I still had many leftover.</p>
                <p>These were great fun and I got to learn some cool new things involving Processing, Java and SQL. They were also a great opportunity to finally be able to work together with other programmers - as I had been studying solo the entire time.</p>
                <p>However, as these were only a couple of first year classes late in my degree, they wouldn't be enough to really break into the industry after graduation.</p>

                <h3>Tertiary Round Two</h3>
                <p>Finally I came across a Coder Academy advertisement one day randomly while job-hunting in the business sector at an event in Luna Park.
                <p>It looked pretty cool so I went and checked out the place on the day, and it turned out to be just what I was looking for in terms of IT sector education.</p>
                <p>So I enrolled, and here we are.</p>
