#brief
This website is built to be a way to show some aspects of my personality and my coding portfolio, and give a self-introduction to any visitors.


#functionality/features
In terms of features, the site employs a lot of Flexbox and opaque images. With primary elements of interactivity; the logo in the center of the navbar spins and changes color upon hover, semi-transparent black overlays light up to reveal text and images underneath on the interests page, scrollbars are implemented throughout, and the linkbar at the bottom of the portfolio page changes colors upon the fulfillment of the hover and active states.
Content-wise, the site includes; 1) home section with a brief self-introduction and contacts bar, as well as a makeshift blog filled with lorem ipsum. 2) An interests section that shows four different personal interests to the reader. 3) A Me + Coding section that tracks my coding journey via brief story snippets. 4) A portfolio section that has a brief recent career/education overview, some selected coding projects and a linkbar to professional profiles.
